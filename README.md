# The Exchange
## <i>The early workings of a network based RPG.</i>

### Project Description
I started this project after a year of experimentation learning more around how SDL2 and OpenGL operate.
After many attempts and some trial and error, I am finally beginnning to make progress on building an engine
(more, a <b>backend</b>) to power an online RPG.

### Policy
My intent is to make this '<i>game</i>' as immersive as possible. While I believe that most game developers' intent is
to achieve this, I wish to keep this in mind while building the engine. I want to limit the amount of UI and menus the
player is subject to and allow the player to make the most of the actual game itself. That being said, I don't want
this to become a challenge for the player and I intend to make the lack of UI as simple and seamless as possible.

I also want the game to be able to run on as many different specifications as possible, however, my focus at the moment is to get the
game running and then port to different systems. I am making sure to keep my code as lite and as cross-platform
as possible, opting to use external and standard libraries instead of using any system specific function calls.
